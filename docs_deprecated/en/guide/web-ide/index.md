The Web IDE is divided into three parts:

  ① Sidebar: It includes cloud functions, collections (database management), storage, logs, user settings, and application settings.

  ② Middle Area: After switching between different features, the displayed content will vary. The image shows the function list of cloud functions, code editor, debugging and documentation, NPM dependency management, console (debug logs), and running results (debugging results).

  ③ Status Bar: It displays the name of the current application, running status, and expiration time.

Laf's Web IDE is very simple and allows you to edit cloud functions, operate databases, and manage cloud storage online. You can use a browser anytime, anywhere to edit and publish code.
